-- Multiple-reader, single-writer locks. Used to protect shared resources which
-- may be concurrently read, but only sequentially written.
--
-- All functions are /exception safe/. Throwing asynchronous exceptions will not
-- compromise the internal state of an 'RWLock'. This means it is perfectly safe
-- to kill a thread that is blocking on, for example, 'acquireRead'.
--
-- See also Java's version:
-- <http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReadWriteLock.html>
--
-- This module is designed to be imported qualified. We suggest importing it
-- like:
--
-- @
-- import           Control.Concurrent.ReadWriteLock        ( RWLock )
-- import qualified Control.Concurrent.ReadWriteLock as RWL ( ... )

-- Read Write Lock
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{-|
Multiple-reader, single-writer lock. Is in one of three states:

* \"Free\": Read or write access can be acquired without blocking.

* \"Read\": One or more threads have acquired read access. Blocks write access.

* \"Write\": A single thread has acquired write access. Blocks other threads
from acquiring both read and write access.

-- * Read access
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{-|
Acquire the read lock.

Blocks if another thread has acquired write access. If @acquireRead@ terminates
without throwing an exception the state of the 'RWLock' will be \"read\".

Implementation note: Throws an exception when more than (maxBound :: Int)
simultaneous threads acquire the read lock. But that is unlikely.

{-|
Try to acquire the read lock; non blocking.

Like 'acquireRead', but doesn't block. Returns 'True' if the resulting state is
\"read\", 'False' otherwise.

{-|
Release the read lock.

If the calling thread was the last one to relinquish read access the state will
revert to \"free\".

It is an error to release read access to an 'RWLock' which is not in the
\"read\" state.

A convenience function wich first acquires read access and then performs the
computation. When the computation terminates, whether normally or by raising an
exception, the read lock is released.
-}
withRead :: RWLock -> IO a -> IO a
withRead = liftA2 bracket_ acquireRead releaseRead

{-|
A non-blocking 'withRead'. First tries to acquire the lock. If that fails,
'Nothing' is returned. If it succeeds, the computation is performed. When the
computation terminates, whether normally or by raising an exception, the lock is
released and 'Just' the result of the computation is returned.

* When the state is \"write\", @waitRead@ /blocks/ until a call to
'releaseWrite' in another thread changes the state to \"free\".
